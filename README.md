# uae_cancerpatients_dataset
Project Overview

This project looks at data from cancer patients to understand how different treatments relate to their outcomes.
We used a dataset from Kaggle and worked on cleaning and organizing the data, then explored patterns using visualizations.
After that, we applied machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict treatment results.
The goal is to find helpful insights that can support doctors and researchers in making better decisions for patient care.
